### Notes/Warnings!!!!

FTP Issue:
```sh
$ It would seem that if you are wanting to stay up to date via using FTP, you might (and probably should) reboot your switch after downloading a new version. (thanks DazedandRemoved)
```

SX OS Cheat Activation Issue:
```sh
$ It seems that sx os activates cheats based on index, so when adding more cheats (without rebooting that is.) You should disable all cheats that are turned on, then re-enable them afterwards to limit issues. (thanks @AnalogMan)
```
