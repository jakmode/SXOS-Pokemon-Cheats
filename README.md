Intstructions:
Download/Clone This repository and add it to the root of your SD Card.

UPDATE#1 (11/19/2018)
Added Credit to parts and ideas for the new shiney code

UPDATE# (11/19/2018)
Added New Codes that make all Pokemon Shiny (Thanks to @AnalogMan)

UPDATE# (11/16/2018)
Added New Codes to PLGE that would let you play as Pikachu or Eevee (dialogues and Moves still remains the same as Eevee)

NOTE!!!

It seems if you are wanting to stay up to date via FTP you might (probably should) have to reboot your switch after downloading a new version. (thanks DazedandRemoved)

It also seems that sx os activates cheats based by index so when adding more cheats (without rebooting) you should disable all cheats that are turned on then reenable them. (thanks AnalogMan)
